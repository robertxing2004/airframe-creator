This Python script collects data from various airliner databases to help the user create Simbrief profiles for flight simulation.

The scraping functions are built with Selenium, and the app currently pulls data from rzjets.com and seatguru.com.
(While airframes.org has a more extensive aircraft database, scraping bots are against their terms of service)

Future additions will include an ability to pull data from airfleets.net, which can also provide seating information.
